                <p>Chicago Tech Academy's newsletter needed to communicate a brand immediately–a modern product combining the school's tech identity with the diversity of the students it serves.</p> 
                <p>Descriptive headlines frame student-focused imagery, and highlighted pull-quotes are set beside short article synopses–establishing a thematic voice for each piece. Since the redesign, open-rates have climbed, and traffic to volunteer and support sections of ChiTech.org has increased.</p>

                <p>For an open enrollment school like ChiTech, recruitment is imperative. Effectively communicating the opportunities and experience offered at ChiTech ensures that the most qualified and ambitious students enroll—boosting school performance, and establishing a culture of achievement.</p>
                <p>A late-progression of ChiTech's visual rebranding, the informational piece has a clean, engaging layout that juxtaposes visuals of student work in action with highlights of mission-centric school activities. The counseling office can't print replacements fast enough—it's the most popular ChiTech handout at middle-school fairs.</p>

                <img src="assets/images/chitech-donate-graphic-600px.jpg">
                <p>Prospective donors want to know how their contributions make a direct impact on students. As a replacement for a lengthy narrative on ChiTech's donate page, <i>Give the Future</i> offered supporters a concise outline of how their dollars create opportunities.</p>
                <p>Within a descending visual hierarchy, the graphic quickly informs visitors how the school's motto of 'Inspire, Educate, Connect' is realized through educational programs. </p>

                <img src="assets/images/chitech-futures-600px.jpg">
                <p>Corporate partners want to <i>engage</i> with students, and that means offering events that break down the wall between the audience and the young presenters. I designed ChiTech Futures to be the solution—supporters didn't RSVP their attendance, they chose mentor opportunities that leveraged their skills and experience to help students learn.</p>
                <p>Organized just shy of 3 weeks, we had to let the tech community know everything there was to know about ChiTech Futures in one page. The new format and effective outreach resulted in the best attendance and most positive partner feedback of all ChiTech's 2014/2015 events.</p>

                <p>Outreach communications for a non profit high school have to be utilitarian—with a small development team and a limited budget, materials need to be designed for long-life and maximum impact. <i>The ChiTech Impact</i> was created to show corporate partners, potential donors, district administrators, and even prospective students how well the school could deliver on promises of achievement.</p>
                <p>A scaled version of a visual-report to Chicago Public Schools, I wanted to use a bright color palette with clean and simple visuals that would highlight ChiTech's impressive achievement data.</p>

                <img src="assets/images/chitech-fireside-chat-600px.jpg">
                <p>The first new event I created for ChiTech was the Fireside Chat in April of 2014. It was a panel discussion titled 'Women in Corporate America: Conform or Transform', and was a collaborative event between ChiTech's Young Women's Leadership Society and female executives. </p>
                <p>Planned as first in a series of annual panel events, Fireside needed a visual brand. When Loyola offered to host Fireside at their loop campus in front of an <i>actual fireplace</i>, it inspired a logo design with a nod to both the past and the future of the 'fireside chat' format.</p>
