                <p>I engage people. I take causes, missions, and visions, and connect them with an audience. Drawing on my experience as a designer, a writer, and an external relations professional, I craft experiences that resonate, communications with voice, and strategies that succeed. When I'm not doing that, I'm obsessing over FC Barcelona, japanese chef's knives, unrealized utopian communities, and really good book jacket design.</p>

                <p>A cynic might have called it self-congratulatory, but when the giant screen high above a beleaguered Iker Casillas flashed the day's record-breaking attendance, the ensuing cheer wasn't the boastful lazy jog of the bases after a homerun, it felt like friends applauding the host's fine meal&#8212;the communal pride of a good thing shared."</p>

                <p>"In February of 2013, The Guardian's Sid Lowe wrote his piece Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Cotsa, a feature that held a grinning admiration for Atleti's rising talent Diego Costa, framing him as a pantomime villain whose technique consisted of a knack for goals cloaked beneath a repertoire antics&#8212;a Snidely Whiplash whose oncoming train scheme actually results in a bisected damsel.</p>
                <p>A little over a year later, and Costa is no longer just a tall bag of tricks, the Brazilian-cum-Spaniard has clawed and elbowed and shouldered his way to stand beside the names of Messi, Ronaldo, Suarez and Zlatan. The pantomime has been replaced by ruthless efficiency, leading the line of one of European football's most exhilarating rebellions as Atletico Madrid captured the first Spanish league title not won by Barca or Real in over a decade.

Perhaps I've lost too many online matches to absurd Drogba headers or chased Robben too long down the sideline, but hearing about a new 'First Touch System' or 'Refined Tactical Free-Kicks' just doesn't get me going. It all adds up to just more ways to press A,X,Y, and B&#8212;but none of it has Pepe Reina stomping on my hand."</p>

It involves at the very least phone calls to a corporate hotline, and at the most an actual visit to Game Stop, so the transaction may yet clear. The ritual is habit now&#8212;15 seasons of manager mode, taking a dog of a team to win many consecutive Champion's League trophies before accepting an offer at Barcelona, all which is followed by the torrid self-abuse of online seesions played against mouthy foreigners whose XBox Live messages prove at least the weakness of FIFA's Respect campaign is digitally reflected."</p>
